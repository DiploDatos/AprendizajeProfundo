    "\n",
    "There are two major package managers in Python: pip and conda. For this tutorial we will be using conda which, besides being a package manager is also useful as a version manager. There are two main ways to install conda: Anaconda and Miniconda. Any will be useful for this course, just follow instructions here, according to your operative system:\n",

    "\n",
    "This year we will be using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) as the library to build and train the deep learning models. The library is a little less abstract than other possibilities such as [Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras) but gives a little more control to the user which in turns allows more customisation.\n",

In your local machine, you will install the version that only has CPU support (i.e. no CUDA version), but in Nabucodonosor you need to install the version with GPU support.\n",
